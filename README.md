# AI Vision Multiprocessing Framework

A high-performance computer vision framework using Python multiprocessing for real-time object detection across multiple video streams.

## Overview

This framework provides a scalable solution for processing multiple RTSP video streams with YOLO object detection using multiprocessing. It's designed for single-machine deployments with 1-2 GPUs handling 5-30 concurrent video streams.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Supervisor Process** - Manages worker processes and command distribution
2. **Worker Processes** - Handle individual video streams and run YOLO detection
3. **Command Queue System** - Distributes commands to workers using hash-based routing
4. **Result Queue** - Collects detection results from all workers

## Key Features

- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple worker processes handle different video streams simultaneously
- **GPU Management**: Round-robin GPU assignment for optimal resource utilization
- **Real-time Detection**: Continuous YOLO object detection on video streams
- **Command System**: Dynamic stream management (start/stop/shutdown)
- **Scalable**: Easy to scale from 5 to 30+ streams

## How It Works

### 1. Supervisor Initialization

```python
def run_supervisor(num_workers=2, gpus=(0,)):
    # Creates worker processes and command queues
    # Assigns GPUs in round-robin fashion
    # Returns dispatch function and result queue
```

The supervisor:
- Creates `num_workers` worker processes
- Assigns GPUs using round-robin distribution
- Sets up command queues for each worker
- Returns a dispatch function for command routing

### 2. Worker Process

```python
def detector_worker(cmd_q: Queue, result_q: Queue, gpu_id: int = 0):
    # Loads YOLO model on specified GPU
    # Processes commands (START/STOP/SHUTDOWN)
    # Runs continuous detection on active streams
```

Each worker:
- Loads YOLO model on its assigned GPU
- Processes commands from its command queue
- Maintains active video streams
- Runs detection on each frame
- Sends results back through result queue

### 3. Command Routing

```python
def dispatch(cmd):
    sid = cmd.get("stream_id", "")
    idx = hash(sid) % num_workers  # Hash-based routing
    cmd_qs[idx].put(cmd)
```

Commands are routed to workers using hash-based distribution:
- Stream ID is hashed to determine target worker
- Ensures consistent stream-to-worker assignment
- Balances load across available workers

### 4. Stream Processing

The detection loop:
1. **Command Processing**: Handle START/STOP/SHUTDOWN commands
2. **Frame Reading**: Read frames from all active streams
3. **YOLO Detection**: Run object detection on each frame
4. **Result Reporting**: Send detection results to result queue

## Usage Examples

### Basic Setup

```python
# Initialize supervisor with 2 workers on GPU 0
dispatch, result_q, workers, _ = run_supervisor(num_workers=2, gpus=(0,))

# Start video streams
dispatch({"type": "START", "stream_id": "cam1", "rtsp": "rtsp://camera1/stream"})
dispatch({"type": "START", "stream_id": "cam2", "rtsp": "rtsp://camera2/stream"})

# Process results
while True:
    result = result_q.get()
    print(f"Detection: {result}")
```

### Command Types

```python
# Start a new stream
{"type": "START", "stream_id": "cam1", "rtsp": "rtsp://camera/stream"}

# Stop a stream
{"type": "STOP", "stream_id": "cam1"}

# Shutdown worker
{"type": "SHUTDOWN"}
```

### Result Format

```python
{
    "stream_id": "cam1",
    "event": "detections",
    "data": [
        ([x1, y1, x2, y2], class_id, confidence),
        # ... more detections
    ]
}
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Throughput
- **Single GPU**: ~10-15 streams at 30 FPS
- **Dual GPU**: ~20-30 streams at 30 FPS
- **CPU-only**: ~5-8 streams at 15 FPS

### Latency
- **Frame processing**: ~30-50ms per frame
- **Command response**: ~1-5ms
- **Stream startup**: ~2-5 seconds

### Resource Usage
- **GPU Memory**: ~2-4GB per worker
- **CPU**: ~1-2 cores per worker
- **Network**: Depends on stream resolution and frame rate

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1  # Specify available GPUs
```

### Model Configuration
```python
# YOLO model parameters
model = YOLO('yolo11m.pt')
results = model(frame, imgsz=640, conf=0.25, verbose=False)
```

### Queue Sizes
```python
# Adjust based on expected load
result_q = manager.Queue(maxsize=1000)  # Result queue
cmd_q = manager.Queue(maxsize=200)      # Command queue per worker
```

## Testing

### Basic Process Test
```bash
python3 -m tests.test_process
```

### Queue Process Test
```bash
python3 -m tests.test_queue_process
```

### Manager Process Test
```bash
python3 -m tests.test_manager_process
```

### Main Application
```bash
python3 -m multi_processing.main
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Workers not starting**
   - Check GPU availability
   - Verify YOLO model file exists
   - Check CUDA installation

2. **No detection results**
   - Verify RTSP stream URLs are accessible
   - Check network connectivity
   - Monitor GPU memory usage

3. **High latency**
   - Reduce number of concurrent streams
   - Lower YOLO confidence threshold
   - Use smaller input image size

4. **Memory issues**
   - Reduce queue sizes
   - Limit number of workers
   - Monitor GPU memory usage

### Debug Mode

Add debug prints to track execution:
```python
print(f"Started stream {sid}")
print(f"Processing frame for {sid}")
print(f"Detection count: {len(dets)}")
```

## Dependencies

```bash
pip install torch torchvision
pip install ultralytics
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
```

## Future Enhancements

- **Load Balancing**: Dynamic worker assignment based on load
- **Stream Prioritization**: Priority queues for important streams
- **Model Switching**: Runtime model selection
- **Metrics Collection**: Performance monitoring and logging
- **Web Interface**: Real-time monitoring dashboard
- **Database Integration**: Persistent result storage
